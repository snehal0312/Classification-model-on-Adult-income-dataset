# Classification-model-on-Adult-income-dataset
# Objective & synopsis

* **The objective of this case study is to fit binary classifiers to predict whether an individual earns more than USD 50,000 (50K) or less in a year using the 1994 US Census Data sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

* **The descriptive features include 4 numeric and 7 nominal categorical features. 
* **The target feature has two classes defined as "<=50K" and ">50K" respectively. 
* **The full dataset contains about 45K observations.
* ** Our goal is to create a predictive model that will be able to output a single decision i.e. whether the income of given person exceeds $50k per year - based on other information about the individual.**
